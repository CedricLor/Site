        <p>
          Thank you for visiting the page of the Centre for the Franco-russian and Franco-chinese friendship. Our centre aims at making the world a place dominated by a triad of super-powers that will enslave all the other people of the world to its common cultural ideology.
        </p>
        <p>
          We truly hope that you like our project and you will join us dominating the world.
